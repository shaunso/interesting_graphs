# interesting_graphs
Website with cool graphs and statistics.

This is my website of implementing all that I've learnt so far in my FE journey.

This will be a gradual process, with the intention of starting this site to test my understanding of core concepts before incrementally making additions to the site to prove my understanding of the fancier side of things.

The point of this is for me to see my grow!!! Something for me to look back on.

I will first focus on getting teh HTML and CSS right before adding functionality at the end.

Goal is to at least add one new graph everyday, and add further functionality to the site.

-My envisioned end product is a site that uses d3.js or any other library to dynamically draw vaious types of charts and graphs -> receives the data from a DB
-Sites should have multiple pages that include (at least) a contact, an about page (including our mission and values), etc.
-Site will initially focus on various statistics on Zimbabwe, with the data retrived from various sources [right now I'm physically doing this myself, but at the end, I should be able to scrap this data and implement APIs]
-Site should be searchable
-Should explore the idea of checking out

-The site will be responive, laid out in a grid, with the homepage showing various grpahs by sector, but clickable that goes into the data itself
-Site should show different graphs each time a user refreshes the site
